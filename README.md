# A hybrid evolutionary search for the generalized quadratic multiple knapsack problem
This repository includes the source code and the best solution certificates of the proposed HESA algorithm published in an EJOR paper titled with "A hybrid evolutionary search for the generalized quadratic multiple knapsack problem".

The two sets of 96 benchmark instances were first introduced in Saraçand Sipahioglu (2014) and later used in Adouani et al. (2019) , Avci and Topaloglu (2017) , Chen and Hao (2016). To facilitate the further research, we upload the instances here.
